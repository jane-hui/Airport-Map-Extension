Coursera - Airport Map Extension

-In my program, it is able to display all the airports in the world as features. 
-The airports are displayed in three different colors, indicating three groups of altitude level. 
-At the same time, when user hovers around the airport markers, it gets to display each airport's information (its name and altitude numeral value) at first line, and where it located (city and country) at second line. 
-Furthermore, when user clicks on a single airport marker, it shows the selected airport marker (in white circle look) together with the routes which connect to other airports. 
-User can hover on other airports to know which airport it gets to fly to from the selected airport. Besides, user also able to zoom in the map to look into detail of the airports he interested.
