# Airport Map Extension

[Project for Object Oriented Programming in Java]


* This program is able to display all the airports in the world. 

* Airports are displayed in three different colors, indicating three groups of altitude level. 

* At the same time, when a user hovers around the airport markers, it will display general information for individual airport (its name and altitude numeral value) at the first line, and its location (city and country) at the second line. 

* Furthermore, when a user clicks on a single airport marker, it will show the selected airport marker in white circle look together with the routes which connected to other airports. 

* A user can hover on other airports to know which destination airports can be reached by from the selected airport. Besides, the user is able to zoom in the map to look into the details of the airports.

* Screenshots of the program can be found in [[Screenshots] Folder](https://github.com/janehui0820/Airport-Map-Extension/tree/master/%5BScreenshots%5D)
